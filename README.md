# This is Solar Year, a special edition release by JL.

"Solar Year" is an SVG Animation.

I created it purely with HTML code rendering SVG graphics in real time. 

This isn't a movie or photo.

Artist Statement: Solar Year represents the fascinating, constant march of time through the universe. The planets rotate, at scale, proportional their own Solar Year. For example, the Earth sphere is scaled from 365.25 days per year to 36525ms to complete a rotation around the Sun sphere.
